Now that we are familiar with the representation of geometric data that the GPU expect, we can load it from a file instead of hard-coding it in the source code. This is the occasion to introduce some basic **resource management** to our project (althrough this is not specific to WebGPU).

File format
-----------

### Example

The file format I introduce here is not standard, but it is simple enough to parse. Here is the content of `webgpu.txt`, which I put in a `resources/` directory:

```C++
[points]
# x   y      r   g   b

0.5   0.0    0.0 0.353 0.612
1.0   0.866  0.0 0.353 0.612
0.0   0.866  0.0 0.353 0.612

0.75  0.433  0.0 0.4   0.7
1.25  0.433  0.0 0.4   0.7
1.0   0.866  0.0 0.4   0.7

1.0   0.0    0.0 0.463 0.8
1.25  0.433  0.0 0.463 0.8
0.75  0.433  0.0 0.463 0.8

1.25  0.433  0.0 0.525 0.91
1.375 0.65   0.0 0.525 0.91
1.125 0.65   0.0 0.525 0.91

1.125 0.65   0.0 0.576 1.0
1.375 0.65   0.0 0.576 1.0
1.25  0.866  0.0 0.576 1.0

[indices]
 0  1  2
 3  4  5
 6  7  8
 9 10 11
12 13 14
```

It is basically the content of the `pointData` and `indexData` defined previously as C++ vectors, introduced by a line of the form `[section name]`. Lines that are empty or starting with a `#` are ignored.

### Parser

I am not going to detail the parser. I believe it is rather simple to understand, and it is not the core topic of this lecture.

Plus once we'll start using 3D data we will switch to a more standard format anyways.

```C++
#include <filesystem>
#include <fstream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

namespace fs = std::filesystem;

bool loadGeometry(const fs::path& path, std::vector<float>& pointData, std::vector<uint16_t>& indexData) {
	std::ifstream file(path);
	if (!file.is_open()) {
		return false;
	}

	pointData.clear();
	indexData.clear();

	enum class Section {
		None,
		Points,
		Indices,
	};
	Section currentSection = Section::None;

	float value;
	uint16_t index;
	std::string line;
	while (!file.eof()) {
		getline(file, line);
		if (line == "[points]") {
			currentSection = Section::Points;
		}
		else if (line == "[indices]") {
			currentSection = Section::Indices;
		}
		else if (line[0] == '#' || line.empty()) {
			// Do nothing, this is a comment
		}
		else if (currentSection == Section::Points) {
			std::istringstream iss(line);
			// Get x, y, r, g, b
			for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
				iss >> value;
				pointData.push_back(value);
			}
		}
		else if (currentSection == Section::Indices) {
			std::istringstream iss(line);
			// Get corners #0 #1 and #2
			for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
				iss >> index;
				indexData.push_back(index);
			}
		}
	}
	return true;
}
```

Loading resources from disc
---------------------------

### Basic approach

We can replace the definition of the `pointData` and `indexData` vectors by a call to our new `loadGeometry` function.

```C++
std::vector<float> pointData;
std::vector<uint16_t> indexData;

bool success = loadGeometry("resources/webgpu.txt", pointData, indexData);
if (!success) {
	std::cerr << "Could not load geometry!" << std::endl;
	return 1;
}
```

A problem we have with this hard-coded relative path is that its interpretation depends on the directory from which you run your executable:

```
my_project> ./build/App
(Working all right)
my_project> cd build
my_project/build> ./App
Could not load geometry!
```

In the second case, your program tries to open `my_project/build/resources/webgpu.txt`, which does not exist. There are a few options to address this:

 - **Option A** Don't care, just call your program from the right directory. It could be annoying, and the problem is that IDEs usually run the executable from `build/` or even a subdirectory of `build/`.
 - **Option B** Use an absolute path. This will only work on your machine, which is quite of a limitation.
 - **Option C** Use an absolute path that is automatically generated thanks to CMake. This is what we'll do.
 - **Option D** Use a command line argument to tell the program where to find the resource directory. This is an interesting option, which can be used in combination with *Option C*, but requires a bit more work.
 - **Option E** Automatically copy the resources in the directory from which your IDE launches the program. This will be a problem once we try to modify resources while the program is running (which is quite handy when writing shaders).

### Resource path resolution

We will do something like this:

```C++
#define RESOURCE_DIR "/home/me/src/my_project/resources"
loadGeometry(RESOURCE_DIR "/webgpu.txt", pointData, indexData);
```

Except that the `#define RESOURCE_DIR` will be added by CMake rather than being explicitly written in our source code!

```{note}
When putting two *string literals* next to each others in a C or C++ source code, like in `loadGeometry("resource" "/webgpu.txt"`, ...), they are automatically concatenated. This is precisely meant for our use case to work!
```

To define `RESOURCE_DIR` in the `CMakeLists.txt` you can add this after creating the `App` target:

```CMake
target_compile_definitions(App PRIVATE
	RESOURCE_DIR="${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/resources"
)
```

The expression `${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}` is replaced by the content of CMake's variable [`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR.html), which is a build in variable containing the full path to the `CMakeLists.txt` file that you are editing.

```{note}```
When writing a CMake *function*, the `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` variable contains the directory of the `CMakeLists.txt` that is currently calling the function. If you want to refer to the directory of the `CMakeLists.txt` that defines the function, use [`CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR.html) instead.

### Portability

> ðŸ˜’ Hey but in the end our executable uses an **absolute path**, so we have this **portability issue** when trying to share it, right?

Yes indeed, but we can easily add an option to globally change the resource directory when building a release that we want to be able to distribute:

```CMake
# We add an option to enable different settings when developping the app than
# when distributing it.
option(DEV_MODE "Set up development helper settings" ON)

if(DEV_MODE)
	# In dev mode, we load resources from the source tree, so that when we
	# dynamically edit resources (like shaders), these are correctly
	# versionned.
	target_compile_definitions(App PRIVATE
		RESOURCE_DIR="${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/resources"
	)
else()
	# In release mode, we just load resources relatively to wherever the
	# executable is launched from, so that the binary is portable
	target_compile_definitions(App PRIVATE
		RESOURCE_DIR="./resources"
	)
endif()
```

You can then have 2 different builds of your project in two different directories:

```
cmake -B build-dev -DDEV_MOD=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake -B build-release -DDEV_MOD=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

The first one for comfort of development, the second one for the portability of a release.

```{tip}
The `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` option is a built-in option of CMake that is very commonly used. Set it to `Debug` to be compile your program with **debugging symbols* (see [debugging](/appendices/debugging.md)), at the expense of a slower and heavier executable. Set it to `Release` to have a fast and lightweight executable with no debugging safe-guard.

When using some CMake generators, like the Visual Studio one, this is ignored because the generated solution can switch from Debug to Release mode directly in the IDE instead of asking CMake.
```

### Shaders

Now that we have a basic resource path resolution mechanism, I strongly suggest we use to load our shader code, instead of hard-coding it in the C++ source as we have been doing from the beginning. We can even include the whole shader module creation call:

```C++
ShaderModule loadShaderModule(const fs::path& path, Device device) {
	std::ifstream file(path);
	if (!file.is_open()) {
		return nullptr;
	}
	file.seekg(0, std::ios::end);
	size_t size = file.tellg();
	std::string shaderSource(size, ' ');
	file.seekg(0);
	file.read(shaderSource.data(), size);

	ShaderModuleWGSLDescriptor shaderCodeDesc{};
	shaderCodeDesc.chain.next = nullptr;
	shaderCodeDesc.chain.sType = SType::ShaderModuleWGSLDescriptor;
	shaderCodeDesc.code = shaderSource.c_str();
	ShaderModuleDescriptor shaderDesc{};
	shaderDesc.hintCount = 0;
	shaderDesc.hints = nullptr;
	shaderDesc.nextInChain = &shaderCodeDesc.chain;
	return device.createShaderModule(shaderDesc);
}
```

Move the original content of the shaderSource variable into `resources/shader.wsl` and replace the module creation step by:

```C++
std::cout << "Creating shader module..." << std::endl;
ShaderModule shaderModule = loadShaderModule(RESOURCE_DIR "/shader.wsl");
std::cout << "Shader module: " << shaderModule << std::endl;
```

This way, you **no longer need to rebuild** the application when you only want to change the shader!

Adjustments
-----------

<!--
### Alignment

TODO

```C++
indexData.resize((size_t)ceil(indexData.size() / (float)4) * 4);
```
-->

### Transform

If you run the program now you should get something like this:

```{figure} /images/loaded-webgpu-logo-transform-issue.png
:align: center
:class: with-shadow
Our loaded shape is a bit off, we should move it to better center it!
```

So how do we "move" the object? Similarly to how we fixed the ratio issue in the previous chapter, we can do it in the **vertex shader**, by adding something to the `x` and `y` coordinates:

```rust
let offset = vec2<f32>(-0.6875, -0.463);
out.position = vec4<f32>(in.position.x + offset.x, (in.position.y + offset.y) * ratio, 0.0, 1.0);
```

```{note}
It is important to apply the scene transform **before** the viewport transform (the ratio). We will get back on this more in detail when adding the 3D to 2D projection transform needed for [drawing 3D meshes](/basic-3d-rendering/3d-meshes.md)!
```

```{figure} /images/loaded-webgpu-logo-colorspace-issue.png
:align: center
:class: with-shadow
The WebGPU Logo loaded from the file, with wrong colors.
```

### Color space

You are not just being picky, there is indeed **something wrong** with the colors! Compare to the logo in the left panel, the colors in the window seem lighter, and even have a different tint.

> ðŸ™„ Hum maybe you made a mistake when writing the file you provided.

Nice try, but nope. To convince you let's take a look at the color of the first 3 lines of the file, which correspond to the biggest triangle:

```
0.0 0.353 0.612
```

These are *red*, *green* and *blue* values expressed in the range $(0,1)$ but let's **remap** them to the integer range $[0,255]$ (8-bit per channel) which is what your screen most likely displays (and hence what usual image file format store):

```
0 90 156
```

Now we can check on a screen capture the color of the big triangle:

```{figure} /images/color-pick.png
:align: center
:class: with-shadow
Color picking the big triangle in a screenshot of our windows shows a color of $(0, 160, 205)$.
```

Oh oh, it does not match.

TODO This related to `swapChainFormat`

```{admonition} Dawn
Since the Dawn implementation only supports the format `BGRA8Unorm` for the surface, you should directly see correct colors in that case.
```

```rust
// We apply a gamma-correction to the color
let corrected_color = pow(in.color, vec3<f32>(2.2));
return vec4<f32>(corrected_color, 1.0);
```

```{figure} /images/loaded-webgpu-logo.png
:align: center
:class: with-shadow
The WebGPU Logo with gamma-corrected colors.
```

```{figure} /images/color-pick-corrected.png
:align: center
:class: with-shadow
Foo
```
